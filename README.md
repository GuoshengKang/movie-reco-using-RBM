## Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Collaborative Filtering


**Implementation of http://www.machinelearning.org/proceedings/icml2007/papers/407.pdf in python**

- All the codes are in the folder ./code  
- model.py is the main program which runs the training and then predictor.  
- data.py is a module written to extract data from the Netflix Prize dataset.  
- simple_rbm.py is a simple implementation of a rbm for our model.  

- model2.py, data_handler.py, get_trust.py contains the code for our extended model.

- Other files include the report and final presentation.  

- We did not include the dataset as it is 2GB in size.
